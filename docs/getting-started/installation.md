# Installation

CT-FM is built on top of the lighter package, so you don't need to install lighter separately — it comes bundled with all the necessary dependencies.

Follow these steps to install CT-FM on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/project-lighter/CT-FM.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Change into the cloned repository’s directory:
   ```bash
   cd CT-FM
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies**  
   Install all required packages (including lighter) with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

After completing these steps, CT-FM and all its dependencies will be installed and ready for use.
