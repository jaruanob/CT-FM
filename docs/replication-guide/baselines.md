# Baselines :material-chart-box-outline:

The selection of baselines varies depending on the evaluation task. Below is a breakdown by task:

## Whole Body Segmentation

- **Architectural Baseline:** Randomly initialized model.
- **SuPREM**
- **Merlin**
- **VISTA3D, Auto3DSeg, nnUNet:** Results reported in previous studies.

## Tumor Segmentation

- **Auto3DSeg Pipeline**

## Head CT Triage

- **Architectural Baseline:** Randomly initialized model.
- **SuPREM**

All baselines—as well as our methods—are implemented using lighter. For detailed configuration scripts and execution instructions, please refer to the [Downstream Tasks](./downstream.md) section.
