# CT-FM: A 3D Image-Based Foundation Model for Radiological Tasks

![CT-FM Overview](./assets/Figure1.png)

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for CT-FM, a 3D image-based pre-trained foundation model designed for various radiological tasks. CT-FM is trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on a large dataset of 148,000 CT scans. This model aims to address a range of tasks, including whole-body segmentation, tumor segmentation, head CT triage, and medical image retrieval. This work builds upon previous efforts in radiological AI, shifting from task-specific expert models to unified foundation models for broader adaptability and efficiency.

## Key Innovations

*   **Large-Scale 3D Pretraining:** Emphasis on 3D data rather than traditional 2D datasets.
*   **Task-Agnostic Training:** Enabling transferability across various radiological tasks.
*   **Open Source:** Model weights, data, and code are shared for collaborative development.
